# Music_Recommender_System
I built a music recommender system leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text descriptions and suggest music based on content similarity. The project involved multiple stages:

Data Collection: Acquiring a dataset containing video descriptions.

Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalizing text by removing special characters, punctuation, and stopwords while converting text to lowercase.

Feature Extraction: Converting processed text into numerical representations using techniques

Recommender Model: Implementing a content-based filtering approach to compute similarity scores between music descriptions and recommend songs based on user preferences.

User Interaction: Enabling users to input preferences via keywords or sample video URLs, then ranking and displaying the most relevant music recommendations.
